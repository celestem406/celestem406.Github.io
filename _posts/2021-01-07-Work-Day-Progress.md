 Today I ended up finishing my research and I started again with the coding on Sublime text. We started off the day with Typing Club for a bit and then I looked through Sublime text and what code scripts I needed to add pictures onto my Website. It was really interesing to learn more about our planet and what is going on around us. At the start of this project, I did think that Climate change was a problem, but now I really think that it should be someting that we are focusing on and we should be taking steps to save our planet.
