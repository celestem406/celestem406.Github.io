 Today I ended up finishing my research about climate change and how it affects our world, then I started reviewing my coding on Sublime text. We started today off with Typing Club for a bit and then I looked through Sublime text and identified what code scripts I needed to add pictures onto my Website. It was really interesing to learn more about our planet and what is going on around us. At the start of this project, I didn't think that Climate change was a big problem, but now I really think that it should be someting that we are focusing on and we should be taking steps to save our planet.  I want my website to focus on the whole basis of solutions to climate change and use it to advocate of how serious of an issue it is. I uploaded an image relating to the climate change issue.
