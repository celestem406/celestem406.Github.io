Today, we worked on typing club for about 30 minutes. Then we met with Kajari to talk about how last week went. Then, we talked about the canvas, and how we could make an accurate barrier so that the hero could not leave the boundaries of the canvas. We conversed about the hero's position, about how we can change the position of hero and about the sides of the canvas. We also talked about how when we change the position of hero, how it affects the width and the height and what happens to the numbers if we want to change hero's position to a specific place on the canvas. Lastly, Kajari walked us though the code to make the bottom and the right barriers so that hero could not pass them. We needed to determine the height and with of hero and also the height and with of the canvas to make it work.
