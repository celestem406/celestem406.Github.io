Today is the week after thanksgiving break and Kajari instructed us to work on starting our website. To create a new file, first you have to go to Finder and manually create a file. Then you have to go to terminal and from there you have to type in code so later in sublime text you can see the files inside the folder you have created. Then, you go into sublime text and you can open that folder and you can see where you can start with the coding. With this done, you can go into chrome and open file and then open the index.html. 

Once you open projects follow these commands to create an empty index.html file.

* mkdir <name of folder>- used to create a folder, not a file.
* cd <name of folder> - Once you have made the folder, open the folder.
* touch index.html - adds an empty html file so you can start working on the page 
* touch README.md - this just creates a empty file with the name README.md
* touch script.js - creates an empty file called script.js
* touch style.css - this allows you to style the page you are creating.

When you complete everything on Terminal, open up sublime text and open the folder. Then, you can start adding in code in the index.html section
