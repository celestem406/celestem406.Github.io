Last week I encountered many problems with our school chromebooks. Chromebooks have a very limited system for web design. The Problem I encountered was file dragging from a folder related to a web theme.. The chromebooks didn’t allow zip files, which we needed for our blog. My chromebook also didn’'t allow files to be dragged upon Github to install the web theme.
