Today we started learning more about pull requests. Pull requests are changes committed in a branch that are presented to viewers of your repository in github. To initiate a new post/pull request, the following commands are necessary for committing the task: 
* git checkout -b new_post - the purpose of checkout -b is to create a new branch with the name new_post. The branch could have any name you want to give it,but it has to correlate to to the content you are adding as well as the name being descriptive.
Then, just follow the instructions on [this is the link for the commands to follow after](https://celestem406.github.io/2020/09/14/setting-up-git)

This command ' --set-upstream origin edit_pull_request_post' tells github to recognize the branch. After I pushed the post to the cloud,on GitHub you will notice a yellow banner. ! [Picture of Repository](images/new_branch_banner.png).
