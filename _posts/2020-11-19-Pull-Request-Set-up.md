Kajari instructed Osvaldo and I to start creating a new post using pull request. Pull requests are changes committed in a branch that are presented to viewers of your repository in github. To initiate a new post/pull request, the following commands are necessary for committing the task: 
* git checkout -b new_post -  he purpose of checkout -b is to create a new branch with the name new_post 
Then, just follow the instructions on [this is the link for the commands to follow after](https://celestem406.github.io/2020/09/14/setting-up-git).
