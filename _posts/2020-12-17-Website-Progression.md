So, today is the last day that we work this year. Overall, this year has been great. Im thankful that Cape let me be part of their team for one more year. Although we are not in person it has been a meaningful experience for me to continue to be a part of Cape. Today we did typing club again and it was really calming, I also found this website that I will be using. It allows us to type and on the screen we are able to see cars and its sort of like a race with other people. Then, I continued working on my website. I read more about Climate change and I have made a document with all the things I am going to add to my website. For the follwing weeks, I will just be adding the information.
