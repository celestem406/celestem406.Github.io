Today, I did typing club for about an hour. We also built a game, we had to create a new folder locally and work through a tutorial that Kajari provided for us we finished with a game. [This is the article we used](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript) After lunch, I met with Kajari and she provided some feedback. One thing that I need to pay more attention to is to small details, I think that I tend to get overwhelmed and I stress about finishing something, so I tend to rush things. I will be working on paying more attention to details and learning how to take things calmly.
