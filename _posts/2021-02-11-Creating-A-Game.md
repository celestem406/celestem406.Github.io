Today, I did typing club for about an hour. We also built a game, we had to create a new folder locally and work through a tutorial that Kajari provided for us we finished with a game. [This is the article we used](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript). After we were done with the game, we had to push up the game up to a repository in Github, for this we used [This article](https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line). To end this we had to turn the game into a Github page and add the link onto our Github account.
After lunch, I met with Kajari and she provided some feedback. One thing that I need to pay more attention to is to small details, I think that I tend to get overwhelmed and I stress about finishing something, so I tend to rush things. I will be working on paying more attention to details and learning how to take things calmly.
