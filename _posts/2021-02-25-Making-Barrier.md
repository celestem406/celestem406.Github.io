This morning, I started off with typing club. I did about 30 minutes during the hour. Then Kajari instructed Osvaldo and I to change up the game from last week, she wanted us to set boundaries around the game. So, what I did was to find the location of the canvas, then I had to check whether all the greater signs and the less than signs made sense where they were placed. I also had to change the sign of some numbers. At the beginning of the day, we went online and we searched up how to make the barrier. We later found out that it was much easier and that we just needed to understand how the graph works.
