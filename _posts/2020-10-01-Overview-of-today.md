 Today, we had a meeting with Kajari. We mostly talked about what NDM is and what it is used for. NDM is the basic lock for a website, and is also the building block of web. We also looked through some commands, command s is to save, command z is to undo, command r is to reload and to check. For next week, we have to go to view>developer>developer tools. Next week Kajari will be on vacation and we will be working on a To-do list.
