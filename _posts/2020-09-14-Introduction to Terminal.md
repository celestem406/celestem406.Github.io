  Last week we started looking into the Terminal. The terminal is an application that allows us to create simple commands so the computer can read, and follow commands. I first learned how to hide applications that show on the bar of our computer. Then, as Osvaldo, Kajari and I were in a zoom call, we learned different commands. The first command I learned was ‘ls’ which is list/ show, which can be used to check the home directory. Then we learned ‘pwd’ which is to print the working directory, as well as ‘cd’ which is used to change the directory. Lastly, we learned ‘mkdir’ which is used to re-make directories.
