Today we worked on typing club for about 30 minutes. In the morning, Kajari instructed us to continue working on our game from the past week. This week she wanted us to incorporate 2 more monsters onto the game. Before lunch, we were kind of confused thinking that we needed to add another image. Then when we asked Kajari she explained that we didn't need to add another image but that we needed to add a new instance to the monster. After, we ended up pushing what we had and Kajari gave us comments to fix. Then, we slowly fixed the comments and we changed what needed to be changed as well as removed.
