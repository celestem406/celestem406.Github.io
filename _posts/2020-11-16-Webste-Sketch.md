Today, We basically designed what we want our future website to look like. We created images on a paper and we uploaded them to slack for Kajari to see them. On my website, I want to talk about climate change and why its important and some things we can all do to avoid it. I will also be adding many pictures to my website and pettitions to sign. These are the images I created today as an outline for my website ![webpage_image_1](images/assets/image1.jpg) and ![webpage_image_2](images/assets/image2.jpg).
