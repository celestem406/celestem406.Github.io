Today we are looking at Html. [This is the article we used](https://www.learn-html.org/en/Hello%2C_World%21) First of all Html is a Standard developer that stands for Hyper Text Markup Lnaguage, it has been modified over the years to carry information over the internet using hyperlinks. This allows you to click on the links, as they will take you to a different location in the page or to a different page over the internet. 
 We started with the first exersise that told us to write "Hello World!" this introduced us to the `<title>` and `<p>` codes. When you enable the "tittle" code  you have to write it in the `<head>` section.To write a body paragraph or a sentence, the user has to write the code in the body. Ex: `<p>` Insert Example here `</p>`. 
 	the </> always have to be at the beguinning and at the end.
 	*Text headers are used to create the header of a page, such as a paragraph or a sentence- `<h1>`-`<h6>`
 	* Paragraphs are used to follow a sentence or a paragraph after it is denotated  `<p>`
 	*Horistontal Ruler is another name for `<hr/>` it allows a separaration between 2 sections
 	*Link `<a>` allows a link to be written 
 	*List- `<ul>` is for an unordered list
 		*`<ol>`allows an ordered loist
 		*`<li>` alows the user to list elements.
 	*Image- `<img>` enables image coding 
 	*Divider- `<div>` enables the code
 	*Text span- `<span>` enables the code
