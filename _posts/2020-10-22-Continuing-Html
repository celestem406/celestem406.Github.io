Today,the whole day i spent reviewing what i had learned last week because i guess for me it takes a lot of time to learn. I reviwed the "basics",links,lists,images and a little of styles.
We are still using the same link as last time. [This is the article we used] (https://www.learn-html.org/en/Hello%2C_World%21) 
* Links - links was focused on introducing the user on creating a link within Html
	* `<a>` allows a link to be written 
		*Creating a link Example, `<a`href="https://www.google.com">. This is a link to google.
		*Then, you can create a link within the example. `<a` href="#faq">
Lists- This section focuses on introducing the making  of lists in Html. `<ul>` allows an unordered list, `<ol>` allows an ordered list, and `<li>` allows the user to list elements.
	* Example of making an ordered list - 
	`<p>`Here is a list of ordered items:`</p>`
	`<p>`Here is a list of ordered items:`</p>`
`<ol>`
    `<li>`First item`</li>`
    `<li>`Second item`</li>`
    `<li>`Third item`</li>`
`</ol>`
    * Example of using numbers in an ordered list - 
    `<p>`Here is a list of ordered items:`</p>`
`<ol type="1">`
    `<li>`First item`</li>`
    `<li>`Second item`</li>`
    `<li>`Third item`</li>`
`</ol>`
    * Example of making Upper case letters in an ordered list - 
    `<p>`Here is a list of ordered items:`</p>`
`<ol type="A">`
    `<li>`First item`</li>`
    `<li>`Second item`</li>`
    `<li>`Third item`</li>`
`</ol>`
    * Example of making Lower case letters in an ordered list - 
    `<p>`Here is a list of ordered items:`</p>`
`<ol type="a">`
   ` <li>`First item`</li>`
    `<li>`Second item`</li>`
   ` <li>`Third item`</li>`
`</ol>`
