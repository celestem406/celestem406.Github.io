Hello! My name is Celeste Mancilla, and this year I am working with Cape Analytics. This summer wasn't really bad. I had a lot of fun staying at home and keeping myself entertained with books and projects I would choose. I have been working with cape since freshman year,so 2 years now. I am currently a junior in Cristo Rey. We started school this week and we also got all of our classes. Freshman year, we worked with Millie and Feng. We usually got books and sometimes we helped her with some tasks for her like verifying people's information like email addresses and or ways to contact them. Sophomore year was the year where we worked both on coding and on books. We started taking coding classes with Michael as well as helping Feng finish up some books. Then when the pandemic came around, we worked from home, helping with books and roof segmentation. This year I am looking forward to learning new things,and becoming closer with my supervisor, and with osvaldo. I am also looking forward to working on books and with different websites.
