Hello! My name is Celeste Mancilla. I have been working with Cape Analytics since my freshman year in high school.This summer was really fun, despite having to stay at home and practice social distancing. I kept myself busy watching netflix series, painting, coloring and picking up projects around my house. A highlight for me this summer has to be going to the drive in in San Jose. It was a friday and my family and I were very excited. We watched Toy Story 4 and ate so much popcorn. My freshman year at Cape was very interesting, I worked with Millie Garcia and Feng Her. With Millie, I worked on gathering information about people and verifying their phone numbers, as well as their emails. When I worked with Feng, I was introduced to the customer review book system. I often looked for pools, solar panels, and trampolines, as well as identifying the quality of the roof. Sophomore year, I continued with the customer books, and I started working with Labelbox. In Labelbox, I mostly outlined everything on an image such as the roofs, the cars on the sidewalk, the trees and the bushes. Last year, I also worked with Michaell Chen, he gave Osvaldo and I, Introductory classes of Coding. Ever since March, we worked from home due to the pandemic. I was paired with Sikha and Feng,  went over roof quality and ways to classify the types of roofs. This year I am looking forward to learning new things,and becoming closer with my supervisor, and with Osvaldo. I am also looking forward to working on books and with different websites.
