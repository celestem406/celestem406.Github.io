Last week I encountered a few problems with our school chromebook. Our school Chromebooks have a very limited system for web design. The Problem I encountered was file dragging from a folder related to a web theme, the folders woudn't get dropped. The chromebooks didnâ€™t allow zip files, which we needed for our blog. Our screen kept on frezzing, and the termax app was difficult to install because of all the restrictions my computer had.
