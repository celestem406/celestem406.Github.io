Today, we worked on typing club for about 30 minutes in the morning. Then we moved on to work on our websites, one change Kajari instructed us to do was to limit the amount of black space there was on our website, so then we added in the code so we could move some parts of the website closer to the images. Additionally, for every change on our website we have to push it up so it can be approved as a Pull request. On my original drawing of my website I thought of adding more pictures, and then I looked at a document I created and I  thought there were too many pictures and not as many words that I had. So, I wanted to keep the words and the images together so there would be a balance between both. Also, on my original sketch, I wanted to add a box at the end so people could leave information or suggestions. I'm not so sure how to do that, next week I will try to see with what I can come up with so I can either do that or something else.
