Today, I started with 1 hour of typing club. Then Kajari instructed us to work on a game. First, we had to set up the folders and the images we were going to use. We did this by going to finder and adding a new folder to Projects. Then I had to open up termial and add in some things so we could get everything on Sublime text. Then as we added the code we had to go on chrome to check if everything was grunning smoothly. [This is the Article that we used](https://www.codemahal.com/javascript-and-html5-canvas-game-tutorial-code/) When I was done with the game I had to go to Github and make a new repository. [This is the final product](https://celestem406.github.io/catch-monsters/)
