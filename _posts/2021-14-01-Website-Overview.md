Today, we started with Typing Club for about 40 minutes, then we worked on our Websites.[This is my website url] (https://celestem406.github.io/change/) We also met with Kajari today and we went over how our websites looked and some changes we wanted to add to our websites. We made a Repository for our Website so Kajari can check and leave comments as we go along. Some of the comands we are going to use in the future are: 

1. `git init.` -- initialise an empty repository locally (on your computer even if it's not online)
2. `git add .` -- add all the new files 
3. `git commit -m "first commit".` -- create the commit
4. `git branch -M main`  -- create a new main branch called main
5. `git remote add origin git@github.com:celestem406/change.git` -- tells your local repository that it will connect to  git@github.com:celestem406/change.git when it is pushed onto the real internet
6. `git push -u origin main` -- push this repository onto the real internet
in each case wher eyou see the word origin, that means we're referring to github's knowledge of your repository
