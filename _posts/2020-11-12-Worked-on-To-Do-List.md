Today, we worked on a to do list. We looked at the website and copied everything from there onto sublime text. [This is the article we used](https://www.learn-html.org)To start you have to make a folder, then we had to make a file with the name index.html, anyways we had to make several files in this folder. Reminder: to make a folder you have to go finder!!!
Anyways, we completed this at the end of the day, by having Kajari help us with what we got stuck on. That was the end of this week.[This is the website we made](https://celestem406.github.io/todolist/)
