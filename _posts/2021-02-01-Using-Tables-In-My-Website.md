This week I will be using my chromebook beacause I haven't gotten my Macbook. In the morning I worked on typing club for about 35 minutes.Then I logged into my email and onto slack. Then Kajari helped me with my website, we worked on adding tables to the webiste to make it flow. Every time I wanted to make a change on my website I had to commit it locally because I do not have the Macbook which would have made it a little easier to see my progress faster. One change I hope to make is to minimize the ammount of white space by making an image more lenghty.
