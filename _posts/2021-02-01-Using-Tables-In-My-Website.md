This week I will be using my chromebook beacause I haven't gotten my Macbook. In the morning I worked on typing club for about 35 minutes.Then I logged into my email and onto slack. Then Kajari helped me with my website, we worked on adding tables to the webiste to make it flow. Every time I wanted to make a change on my website I had to commit it to the main branch on Github, so basically Github was building the website for me. I had to do this because there was no way I could get any text editors on my Chromebook due to my school's security permission. 

When I have the work Macbook back, and can use an editor and broswer to test my changes out locally, one change I hope to make is to minimize the amount of white space by making an image more lengthy. I will play around with the width and height numbers to see what works for the images and text flow.```
