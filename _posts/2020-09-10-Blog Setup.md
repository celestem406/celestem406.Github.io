Today, I finally set up my own blog, I think I'm getting the hang of this. I think having a blog will help me keep track of the things I will accomplish this year and it will help me look back on the things I have achieved. Today in the morning, we met with Kajari who helped us look over our progress over the last 2 weeks.Last week we encountered some problems that had to do with the files.. The chromebooks were not able to unzip files nor were they able to upload the files.
