* Styles - This section focused on introducing the user to what is CSS and how is it used with Html. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used as a virtual language of the web. CSS is cascading as it defines which styles to use with Html. Examples are (Browser Default, Styles, Element selector, Class and ID selector, Media type)
	* Defining CSS - `<style>` along with the code string `<p style="font-family: sans-serif">` for the font.
	* Using CSS tag - CSS inline isn't recommended, but CSS stylesheets and selectors are good for applying selectors.
	* Using a different stylesheet - CSS stylesheet can be defined in an external file with a (.css extension). Loading it will require the `<link>` tag `<link rel="stylesheet" href="nice.css">`. Must be positioned in the `<head>` section.
* Classes - This section focused on using CSS classes to define CSS Styles and apply them to Html. The next class definition is used as a dot selector:
`<style>`
`.nice{`
	`font-family: sans-serif;`
* Selectors - This section focused on introducing the user to Querying (declare a style to apply to the CSS stylesheet, receive Html elements using the `<querySelector>` code.
* CSS Support - CSS selectors support the `<p>` and `<h1>`-`<h6>` tags
* Descendant and Child Selectors - Despite being able to specify and element type, ID, and class name, creating selectors can be done using `<strong>` tags for the hierarchy of "strongblue" class example.
