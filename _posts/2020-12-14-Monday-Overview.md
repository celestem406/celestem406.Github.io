Today, for about an hour we worked on typing club, it was actually pretty fun and relaxing to do it in the morning. Although the lessons are getting a bit harder I think that it is a good thing to practice. I finished merging the post from last week, and although Kajari had me go back many times, I think that it is good learning experience to do. Then, we continued to work on our Website. Currently I am gathering all the information and everything I want to have on the Website. I have the Introduction, and I will be working this week to see what other things I am going to add on there.
