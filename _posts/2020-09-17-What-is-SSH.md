SSH is a command that provides a secure encrypted connection between 2 computers over an insecure network. Ssh can be used for file transfers, terminal access, and for tunneling different applications. SSH keys are an access credential that is used in the SSH protocol. For SSH to work, it has to have two keys. The first one is a private key that is used to decrypt information from the SSH protocol. The other key, a private key, is used to encrypt information of both the user and server.
